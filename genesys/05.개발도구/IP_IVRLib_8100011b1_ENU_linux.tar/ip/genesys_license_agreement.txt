12.  Proprietary Information.

(a) "Proprietary Information" means all information and material disclosed by the
disclosing party ("Discloser") to the receiving party ("Recipient") (whether in
writing, or in oral, graphic, electronic or any other form) that is marked as (or
provided under circumstances reasonably indicating it is) confidential or proprietary,
or if disclosed orally or in other intangible form or in any form that is not so
marked, that is identified as confidential at the time of such disclosure.
Proprietary Information, includes without limitation, the Genesys Products (including,
without limitation, Developer Materials, Derivative Works, Run-Time License related
information (including through a Genesys online portal), the provisions of this
Agreement and Genesys training, including the Developer Training, and as to all
training the training materials), User Products, Developer Materials, the provisions
of this Agreement, and any trade secrets, know-how, inventions (whether or not
patentable), techniques, processes, programs, ideas, algorithms, formulas, schematics,
testing procedures, software design and architecture, computer code, internal
documentation, design and function specifications, product requirements, problem
reports, performance information, software documents, and other technical, business,
product, marketing and financial information, plans and data. Each party acknowledges
and agrees that the other party's Products embodies substantial creative efforts and
constitutes and contains valuable trade secrets and confidential information of that
party.

(b) Recipient shall hold all Proprietary Information in strict confidence and shall
not disclose any Proprietary Information to any third party, other than to its
employees or agents who need to know such information to perform Recipient's
obligations or exercise Recipient's rights hereunder and who are bound by restrictions
regarding disclosure and use of such information comparable to and no less restrictive
than those set forth herein. Recipient shall not use any Proprietary Information for
the benefit of itself or any third party or for any purpose other than the performance
of Recipient's obligations or exercise of Recipient's rights hereunder. Recipient shall
take the same degree of care that it uses to protect its own confidential and
proprietary information and materials of similar nature and importance (but in no event
less than reasonable care) to protect the confidentiality and avoid the unauthorized
use, disclosure, publication or dissemination of the Proprietary Information. Recipient
shall not make any copies of the Proprietary Information except as necessary to perform
its obligations or exercise its rights hereunder, unless otherwise approved in writing
in advance by Discloser.

(c) The foregoing restrictions on disclosure and use shall not apply with respect to
any Proprietary Information which the Recipient reasonably demonstrates: 
  i.  was or becomes publicly known through no act or omission of Recipient; 
  ii.  was known by Recipient before receipt from Discloser or 
  iii.  becomes known to Recipient without confidential or proprietary restriction
  from a source other than Discloser that does not owe a duty of confidentiality to
  Discloser with respect to such Proprietary Information. In addition to the foregoing,
  Recipient may disclose Proprietary Information to the extent (A) approved by
  Discloser or (B) Recipient is legally compelled to disclose such Proprietary
  Information; provided that Recipient shall (1) promptly notify Discloser of the
  notice compelling disclosure, (2) reasonably cooperate with Discloser in protecting
  against any such disclosure and/or obtaining a protective order narrowing the scope
  of such disclosure and/or use of the Proprietary Information, (3) reproduce any
  confidentiality or proprietary markings appearing on the Proprietary Information in
  the copies of such Proprietary Information, (4) only furnish the portion of the
  Proprietary Information that it is required to disclose and (5) use reasonable
  efforts to obtain reliable assurances that the disclosed Proprietary Information
  shall be treated confidentially. Notwithstanding any such compelled disclosure by
  the Recipient, such compelled disclosure shall not otherwise affect the Recipient's
  obligations hereunder with respect to Proprietary Information so disclosed.

(d) Recipient acknowledges and agrees that due to the unique nature of Discloser's
Proprietary Information, there may be no adequate remedy at law to compensate
Discloser for the breach of any provision regarding License (including grant,
requirements and restrictions), Proprietary Information or Intellectual Property;
that any such breach may result in irreparable harm to Discloser that would be
difficult to measure and that upon any such breach or threat thereof, Discloser
shall be entitled to seek injunctive and other appropriate equitable relief
(without the necessity of proving actual damages), in addition to whatever remedies
it may have at law.

13.  Term and Termination.

(a) This Agreement shall commence upon the Effective Date and continue in full force
and effect for one (1) year unless earlier terminated as provided herein
("Initial Term"). Thereafter, this Agreement shall automatically be renewed for
successive one (1) year terms commencing on each anniversary of the Effective Date

together be referred to as the "Term"), unless earlier terminated as provided herein.
