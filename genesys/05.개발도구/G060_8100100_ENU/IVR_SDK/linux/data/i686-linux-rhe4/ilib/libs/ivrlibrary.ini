# Description: 
#
# ivrlibrary.ini file is used to change the default parameters in ilibrary.  
# ilibrary first configures itself with internal default parameters and then 
# looks for the presence of this file to modify the configuration. When the 
# CME parameters are received in the login response, the CME parameters 
# overide any defaults.
